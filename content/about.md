# About me
Hi! My name is Elroy Parkinson. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa and this is my blog.

I am a Solutions Architect with 20 year's experience as an IT professional. I have a very analytical mind and love finding elegant, simple, cost-effective technical solutions to tough business problems. I am particularly interested in Cloud Architecture, containerization using Kubernetes, Agile software development and Spring Boot micro-services.


I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science from the University of Port Elizabeth (now the [Melson Mandela Metropolitan University](https://www.mandela.ac.za/)) and an MBA from [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au/) in Australia.

# About my blog

## Topics

This blog started out way in 2013. You can read about how embarrassingly optimistic I was about it (as well as the corny reason for the title) in my first post [here](/post/software-pendula/).

Mostly I cover Software Development and Architecture topics that I've had to think about - either as part of my work or sometimes just out interest. I find writing down my thoughts helps me clarify and internalise them. Coming back to what I've written years later also serves to remind me how wrong I can be sometimes despite having been so confident at the time. It's a valuable life lesson. :smile:


## Technical details

As I said, this blog started out on Google's https://www.blogger.com following a (rare) New Year's resolution in 2013. That platform is still around but nowhere near as active as it used to be and so for 2021 I've decided to self-host on Google's Cloud platform using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) framework - mostly as a way to learn more about the tech. The details are probably a good topic for a future post.

Thanks for reading!
